.TH "CMAKE-INSTRUMENTATION" "7" "Dec 08, 2025" "4.2.1" "CMake"
.SH NAME
cmake-instrumentation \- CMake Instrumentation
.sp
Added in version 4.0.

.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This feature is only available when experimental support for instrumentation
has been enabled by the \fBCMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_INSTRUMENTATION\fP gate.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The CMake Instrumentation API allows for the collection of timing data, target
information and system diagnostic information during the configure, generate,
build, test and install steps for a CMake project.
.sp
This feature is only available for projects using the
\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP, \fI\%Ninja Generators\fP or \fI\%FASTBuild\fP\&.
.sp
All interactions with the CMake instrumentation API must specify both an API
version and a Data version. At this time, there is only one version for each of
these: the \fI\%API v1\fP and \fI\%Data v1\fP\&.
.SS Data Collection
.sp
Whenever a command is executed with
instrumentation enabled, a \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP is created in the project build
tree with data specific to that command. These files remain until after
\fI\%Indexing\fP occurs.
.sp
CMake sets the \fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE\fP, \fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_LINK\fP
and \fI\%RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM\fP global properties to use the
\fBctest \-\-instrument\fP launcher in order to capture details of each compile,
link, and custom command respectively. If the project has been configured with
\fI\%CTestUseLaunchers\fP, \fBctest \-\-instrument\fP will also include the
behavior usually performed by \fBctest \-\-launch\fP\&.
.SS Indexing
.sp
Indexing is the process of collating generated instrumentation data. Indexing
occurs at specific intervals called hooks, such as after every build. These
hooks are configured as part of the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP\&. Whenever a hook is
triggered, an index file is generated containing a list of snippet files newer
than the previous indexing.
.sp
Indexing and can also be performed by manually invoking
\fBctest \-\-collect\-instrumentation <build>\fP\&.
.SS Callbacks
.sp
As part of the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP, users can provide a list of callbacks
intended to handle data collected by this feature.
.sp
Whenever \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs, each provided callback is executed, passing the
path to the generated index file as an argument.
.sp
These callbacks, defined either at the user\-level or project\-level should read
the instrumentation data and perform any desired handling of it. The index file
and its listed snippets are automatically deleted by CMake once all callbacks
have completed. Note that a callback should never move or delete these data
files manually as they may be needed by other callbacks.
.SH ENABLING INSTRUMENTATION
.sp
Instrumentation can be enabled either for an individual CMake project, or
for all CMake projects configured and built by a user. For both cases,
see the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP for details on configuring this feature.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation at the Project\-Level
.sp
Project code can contain instrumentation queries with the
\fI\%cmake_instrumentation()\fP command.
.sp
In addition, query files can be placed manually under
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/<version>/query/\fP at the top of a build tree.
This version of CMake supports only one version schema, \fI\%API v1\fP\&.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation at the User\-Level
.sp
Instrumentation can be configured at the user\-level by placing query files in
the \fI\%CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR\fP under
\fB<config_dir>/instrumentation/<version>/query/\fP\&.
.SS Enabling Instrumentation for CDash Submissions
.sp
You can enable instrumentation when using CTest in \fI\%Dashboard Client\fP
mode by setting the \fI\%CTEST_USE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP environment variable.
Doing so automatically enables the \fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP option.
.sp
The following table shows how each type of instrumented command gets mapped
to a corresponding type of CTest XML file.

.TE
.sp
By default the command line reported to CDash is truncated at the first space.
You can instead choose to report the full command line (including arguments)
by setting \fI\%CTEST_USE_VERBOSE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP to 1.
.sp
Alternatively, you can use the \fI\%v1 Query Files\fP to enable instrumentation for
CDash using the \fBcdashSubmit\fP and \fBcdashVerbose\fP options.
.sp
In order for the submitted \fBBuild.xml\fP file to group the snippet files
correctly, all configure and build commands should be executed with CTest in
Dashboard Client mode.
.SH API V1
.sp
The API version specifies the layout of the instrumentation directory, as well
as the general format of the query files and \fI\%cmake_instrumentation()\fP
command arguments.
.sp
The Instrumentation API v1 is housed  in the \fBinstrumentation/v1/\fP directory
under either \fB<build>/.cmake/\fP for output data and project\-level queries, or
\fB<config_dir>/\fP for user\-level queries. The \fBv1\fP component of this
directory is what signifies the API version. It has the following
subdirectories:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBquery/\fP
Holds query files written by users or clients. Any file with the \fB\&.json\fP
file extension will be recognized as a query file. These files are owned by
whichever client or user creates them.
.TP
.B \fBquery/generated/\fP
Holds query files generated by a CMake project with the
\fI\%cmake_instrumentation()\fP command or the
\fI\%CTEST_USE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP variable. These files are owned by CMake
and are deleted and regenerated automatically during the CMake configure step.
.TP
.B \fBdata/\fP
Holds instrumentation data collected on the project. CMake owns all data
files, they should never be removed by other processes. Data collected here
remains until after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and all \fI\%Callbacks\fP are executed.
.TP
.B \fBdata/index/\fP
A subset of the collected data, containing any
\fI\%v1 Index Files\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdata/content/\fP
A subset of the collected data, containing any
\fI\%v1 CMake Content Files\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdata/trace/\fP
A subset of the collected data, containing the \fI\%Google Trace File\fP created
from the most recent \fI\%Indexing\fP\&. Unlike other data files, the most recent
trace file remains even after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and all \fI\%Callbacks\fP are
executed, until the next time \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs.
.TP
.B \fBcdash/\fP
Holds temporary files used internally to generate XML content to be submitted
to CDash.
.UNINDENT
.SS v1 Query Files
.sp
Any file with the \fB\&.json\fP extension under the \fBinstrumentation/v1/query/\fP
directory is recognized as a query for instrumentation data.
.sp
These files must contain a JSON object with the following keys. The \fBversion\fP
key is required, but all other fields are optional.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP
The Data version of snippet file to generate, an integer. Currently the only
supported version is \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcallbacks\fP
A list of command\-line strings for \fI\%Callbacks\fP to handle collected
instrumentation data. Whenever these callbacks are executed, the full path to
a \fI\%v1 Index File\fP is appended to the arguments included in the string.
.TP
.B \fBhooks\fP
A list of strings specifying when \fI\%Indexing\fP should occur automatically.
These are the intervals when instrumentation data should be collated and user
\fI\%Callbacks\fP should be invoked to handle the data. Elements in this list
should be one of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostGenerate\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpreBuild\fP (called when \fBninja\fP  or \fBmake\fP is invoked)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostBuild\fP (called when \fBninja\fP or \fBmake\fP completes)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpreCMakeBuild\fP (called when \fBcmake \-\-build\fP is invoked)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostCMakeBuild\fP (called when \fBcmake \-\-build\fP completes)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostCMakeInstall\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpostCTest\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpreBuild\fP and \fBpostBuild\fP are not supported when using the
\fI\%MSYS Makefiles\fP or \fI\%FASTBuild\fP generators.
Additionally, they will not be triggered when the build tool is invoked by
\fBcmake \-\-build\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBoptions\fP
A list of strings used to enable certain optional behavior, including the
collection of certain additional data. Elements in this list should be one of
the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBstaticSystemInformation\fP
Enables collection of the static information about the host machine CMake
is being run from. This data is collected during \fI\%Indexing\fP and is
included in the generated \fI\%v1 Index File\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP
Enables collection of the dynamic information about the host machine
CMake is being run from. Data is collected for every \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP
generated by CMake, and includes information from immediately before and
after the command is executed.
.TP
.B \fBcdashSubmit\fP
Enables including instrumentation data in CDash. This does not
automatically enable \fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP, but is otherwise
equivalent to having the \fI\%CTEST_USE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP environment
variable enabled.
.TP
.B \fBcdashVerbose\fP
Enables including the full untruncated commands in data submitted to
CDash. Equivalent to having the
\fI\%CTEST_USE_VERBOSE_INSTRUMENTATION\fP environment variable enabled.
.TP
.B \fBtrace\fP
Enables generation of a \fI\%Google Trace File\fP during \fI\%Indexing\fP to
visualize data from the \fI\%v1 Snippet Files\fP collected.

.sp
The \fBcallbacks\fP listed will be invoked during the specified hooks
\fIat a minimum\fP\&. When there are multiple query files, the \fBcallbacks\fP,
\fBhooks\fP and \fBoptions\fP between them will be merged. Therefore, if any query
file includes any \fBhooks\fP, every \fBcallback\fP across all query files will be
executed at every \fBhook\fP across all query files. Additionally, if any query
file requests optional data using the \fBoptions\fP field, any related data will
be present in all snippet files. User written \fBcallbacks\fP should be able to
handle the presence of this optional data, since it may be requested by an
unrelated query.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{
  \(dqversion\(dq: 1,
  \(dqcallbacks\(dq: [
    \(dq/usr/bin/python callback.py\(dq,

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, after every \fBcmake \-\-build\fP or \fBcmake \-\-install\fP
invocation, an index file \fBindex\-<timestamp>.json\fP will be generated in
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/v1/data/index\fP containing a list of data
snippet files created since the previous indexing. The commands
\fB/usr/bin/python callback.py index\-<timestamp>.json\fP and
\fB/usr/bin/cmake \-P callback.cmake arg index\-<timestamp>.json\fP will be executed
in that order. The index file will contain the \fBstaticSystemInformation\fP data
and each snippet file listed in the index will contain the
\fBdynamicSystemInformation\fP data. Additionally, the index file will contain
the path to the generated \fI\%Google Trace File\fP\&. Once both callbacks have completed,
the index file and data files listed by it (including snippet files, but not
the trace file) will be deleted from the project build tree. The instrumentation
data will be present in the XML files submitted to CDash, but with truncated
command strings because \fBcdashVerbose\fP was not enabled.
.SH DATA V1
.sp
Data version specifies the contents of the output files generated by the CMake
instrumentation API as part of the \fI\%Data Collection\fP and \fI\%Indexing\fP\&. A new
version number will be created whenever previously included data is removed or
reformatted such that scripts written to parse this data may become
incompatible with the new format. There are four types of data files generated:
the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP, \fI\%v1 Index File\fP, \fI\%v1 CMake Content File\fP, and the
\fI\%Google Trace File\fP\&. When using the \fI\%API v1\fP, these files live in
\fB<build>/.cmake/instrumentation/v1/data/\fP under the project build tree.
.SS v1 Snippet File
.sp
Snippet files are generated for every compile, link and custom command invoked
as part of the CMake build or install step and contain instrumentation data about
the command executed. Additionally, snippet files are created for the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The CMake configure step
.IP \(bu 2
The CMake generate step
.IP \(bu 2
Entire build step (executed with \fBcmake \-\-build\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Entire install step (executed with \fBcmake \-\-install\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Each \fBctest\fP invocation
.IP \(bu 2
Each individual test executed by \fBctest\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These files remain in the build tree until after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and any
user\-specified \fI\%Callbacks\fP are executed.
.sp
Snippet files have a filename with the syntax \fB<role>\-<hash>\-<timestamp>.json\fP
and contain the following data:
.INDENT 0.0

Trace files follow the \X'tty: link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview'\fI\%Google Trace Event Format\fP\X'tty: link'\&. They include data from
all \fI\%v1 Snippet Files\fP listed in the current index file.
These files remain in the build tree even after \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs and all
\fI\%Callbacks\fP are executed, until the next time \fI\%Indexing\fP occurs.
.sp
Trace files are stored in the \fBJSON Array Format\fP, where each
\fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP corresponds to a single trace event object. Each trace
event contains the following data:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
A descriptive name generated by CMake based on the given snippet data.
.TP
.B \fBcat\fP
The \fBrole\fP from the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBph\fP
Currently, always \fB\(dqX\(dq\fP to represent \fBComplete Events\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBts\fP
The \fBtimeStart\fP from the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP, converted from milliseconds to
microseconds.
.TP
.B \fBdur\fP
The \fBduration\fP from the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP, converted from milliseconds to
microseconds.
.TP
.B \fBpid\fP
Unused (always zero).
.TP
.B \fBtid\fP
An integer ranging from zero to the number of concurrent jobs with which the
processes being indexed ran. This is a synthetic ID calculated by CMake
based on the \fBts\fP and \fBdur\fP of all snippet files being indexed in
order to produce a more useful visualization of the process concurrency.
.TP
.B \fBargs\fP
Contains all data from the \fI\%v1 Snippet File\fP corresponding to this trace event.
